# Multi-Site-Network-Topology-with-Static-and-Floating-Static-Routing
Designed a four-site network with routers, switches, PCs, and servers. Configured static and floating routes for full connectivity and redundancy. Tested with Packet Tracer. Gained skills in routing, troubleshooting, network design, and documentation.


In this project, I designed and implemented a multi-site network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes four locations: Site A, B, C, and D. Each with its own router, switch, and two end devices. Site D also hosts two servers: a Web Server and a File Server.

Each site operates on a separate subnet:

Site A: 192.168.10.0/24

Site B: 192.168.20.0/24

Site C: 192.168.30.0/24

Site D: 192.168.40.0/24

I configured hostnames and passwords on all routers and switches for security. IP addresses were manually assigned to all interfaces, ensuring proper network segmentation. Static routes were set up on each router to enable communication between all sites. In addition, I configured floating static routes with higher administrative distances to provide redundancy in case of a primary route failure.

Connectivity between devices was tested using ping commands and Packet Tracer’s Simulation Mode. For example, PC "OCEANE" at Site A successfully communicated with the Web Server at Site D, confirming network functionality.

This project strengthened my skills in IP addressing, routing, switch and router configuration, network troubleshooting, and redundancy planning. I also gained experience in creating network diagrams and maintaining detailed documentation.
